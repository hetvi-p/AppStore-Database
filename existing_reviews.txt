Facebook Sucks
1
I dont recommend this social platform to anyone unless you love censorship, blocking and public shaming by so called "Independent" Fact checkers. This platform hates free speech and you will be banned for exercising it.
Work to improve this. Please get rid of your sensitive policies and administer real control and policies.
Facebook
I hate this new photo feature?
2
Whatever new photo feature is showing individual photos from gallery postings is super annoying. I want to see the original post which has a published comment or paragraph. Spitting out random photos and not the original post gives no context for the photos. Especially for those who post in their business account.
Please get rid of this new update and reinstate the previous state.
Facebook
Facebook is good for writers
5
I’m giving Facebook five stars because it’s really the *only* social media platform that is good for writers. It allows us space to tell stories, with or without visual aid, and create communities and conversations around that writing.
I hope that in the future Facebook helps amplify writers on its platform and takes notice that it really is a great asset to us (when we actually get reach).
Facebook
Great App
4
Overal amazing app to talk with my friends. However, the story feature isn't as smooth as Instagram's.
I'd like to see you implement the smoothness of stories to Facebook as well.
WhatsApp
Where’s dark mode?
3
It works fine. But where’s dark mode? Surely it can’t take this long to implement it? The app sticks out like a sore thumb.
Please add dark mode.
WhatsApp
Excellent

I love WhatsApp so much I would recommend it to everyone I give it 5 star rating for chatting app’s
Keep up the great work.
WhatsApp
Emojis
4
I think this app is WONDERFUL! But there is some emojis missing, for exemple the GIRAFFE emoji! Some people like me, love giraffes! 
So please, can you make an emoji giraffe?
WhatsApp
Great But Can Be Better
4
One annoying thing with whatsapp is the absence of control over accepting a group invitation. Anyone can create a group and add you , giving you no choice to accept or decline. 
Additionally, the option to block a group just like u block a single user should be available.
BeReal
Great concept, needs work
4
Absolutely in love with this concept! it takes the pressure and toxicity off of social media and adds a fun surprise element for when it’s time to post! i love looking through my friends posts, not feeling pressured to look good or edit anything, and not being embarrassed about how many friends i have, likes i get, etc. amazing concept and the app is good how it is…if it would work properly:/ the app is CONSTANTLY glitching!! almost every single time i get the “time to bereal” notification, i click on it and the app opens but doesn’t prompt me to take my picture, it goes to the screen that shows mine and my friends posts from yesterday but doesn’t update to even take the picture in time.
Please work on this.
BeReal
Not like other social media
5
I really enjoy that BeReal keeps the fun part of social media and minimizes the toxic part.
Keep it up!
BeReal
We Love Being Real!!!

It’s like an insight to everyone’s life that you didn’t know you needed
Keep adding more updates

Glitchy
3
I enjoy the concept of the app, but there needs to be a way to allow users to reattempt to upload their photos due to bad service. When I tried to post my photo tonight, it was taking much longer than it should have. After a minute or two, it said that I uploaded the image, but the app kept glitching out. 
Please fix this

I just love discord. It's so reliable
Keep it up!
Discord
New update reminds me of iMessage...
3
Don’t get me wrong, I love Discord, but ever since the update that made the text box cluttered with so many buttons, I feel like the app lost some of its uniqueness (and gained more glitches, at least with my phone). It feels like iMessages and the text box feels so small when I write because I can only get five or six words to a line when I used to get the entire width of my phone screen besides where the “send” button was (the one that didn’t used to be so obnoxious). I guess you could say I miss the simplicity of the chat box.
Please fix this.
Discord
Integrated Phone Calls
4
Discord is an amazing app that lets you do casual conversations without the loud notifications you would usually get from text messages. It does an amazing job at keeping notifications hidden when you want them to be. But I cannot say the same for calls.
Recently, Discord started integrating their calls with actual phone calls. This means that every time I get called on Discord, it goes through to my ringtone. The whole reason I use Discord is to keep my online life separate from my personal life. Please fix this.
Instagram
Love Instagram but…
4
I’ve been blessed with a black and white information bar that says couldn’t refresh feed for almost a week now and it is really frustrating and annoying and more stress I don’t need added onto my life right now. I’ve tried to uninstall the app and reinstalled it, logged back in, and it does the exact same thing pops the couldn’t refresh feed bar and keeps popping up until the current video has been completely loaded than it will go away.
Please fix this.
Instagram
No help or support
2
I have had troubles with the music feature on instagram for MONTHS now. I am not able to use any music other than the few automatically shown ones that are there when I click the option, and all the songs are in some foreign language or they're instrumentals of some sort. I am not able to search for any song whatsoever as it will just tell me there are no results every time.
Please fix this
Instagram
Used to be about connecting- now it’s just advertising
3
I used to love Instagram as a way to keep in touch with my family and friends. Especially during this time of being apart. However, now with the unbelievable amount of ads it is nearly impossible to see what I want to see (my family and friends) and due to the new - “you’re all done” feature I constantly miss posts and here is why: If I open my feed and look at some posts from friends, I can see there are several I haven’t scrolled to look at yet, I then click over to open a message, when I look back at Instagram those posts are gone and I cannot see them again unless I can possibly remember who posted something and to individually look at each of their pages.
Please fix this.

Amazing App

Google
Keeps Crashing
3
After the latest google app update, the app keeps crashing 30-60 seconds after I open it. Quite frustrating!
Please release a new update to fix this issue
Google
No Image Search
4
My biggest use for this would be to quickly search an image to use as a eme or something. There should def be an image search option
Please develop a feature when I can search using images to find similar pictures and memes

I love the dinosaur game
Please never take the dinosaur game out; but can you add a new level where the dinosaur gets faster as it goes on
Google
Best Search Engine
5
No comparison, best search engine on the internet. The orignal. Internet Explorer and Yahoo have to watch their backs. Doesn't lag and provides very organized results
Keep up the good work
Microsoft Word
It’s Word, man.
5
Great app. Business and academic apps like this are sometimes harder to navigate on iPads or smart devices because you can’t see all the icons like you would on a laptop screen, and the layout is a little different, but it still does mostly everything you’d need for work or school. There are certain things that you can’t do unless you pay and upgrade to premium, like getting unlimited text colors, but that’s pretty much what you get with every app these days. 
Keep it up.
Microsoft Word
Love/Hate relationship with Word on iPad
4
I’ve used Word for years, and I am really good at it and take advantage of the really cool features that other word processor programs lack. The desktop version of Word is amazing!! However, Word on the iPad is mediocre!
Update the iPad app further please.
Microsoft Word
Use with Caution-Random Crashes Cause Data Lisa
3
I have been using Microsoft word on pc, mac, and iPad for several years and mostly had a good experience. Until recently with the iPad app, which I use almost everyday. The app will randomly crash and delete hours worth of progress I had made on a document.
Please fix bugs and glitches
Microsoft Word
Amazing but few tweaks
4
Sometimes, when my laptop shuts up unexpectedly, my docs are lost.
Pleae add an auto-recovery feauture, where I'm able to recover documenst even after they've been closed.
Gmail
I’ve come all the way here to leave a review
1
The fact that I’ve gone out of my way to review an email app should say something. Why on earth can you not select all to delete mass emails through the app? It’s infuriating. I am rarely on my own desktop or laptop at home. 
Do better.
Gmail
Why the change?
3
I’m not loving or even liking a recent change they made. When I click a link in an email and it opens in Chrome or twitter or insta or wherever, and then I click the little arrow at the top left of the screen that says “return to Gmail” it previously would take me back to the email I had open, unless a long period of time had passed and then it might not do that. 
Please revert back.

Possible on desktop, not possible on the app. More liberty with fonts, sizes etc. would improve the experience too. Can’t crop images on desktop or app. Otherwise amazing.
Please add this feature on the app.

Absolute, flaming pile of turds trash. It worked for a while and all of a sudden I lose my documents, it asks me to activate two-factor authentication and then I make an account and nothing is there. Trash.

Duolingo
Take away the health bar!
4
I love this app and how easy and fun it is to learn a new language. My only problem with Duolingo is the fact that there is health, it takes so long for your health to refill fully and why is it that you are limiting the amount we learn. It is so unnecessary.
I would love the app so much more if that was removed.

Chess
BEST CHESS EVER!!!!
5
I had started playing chess around three years ago, but stopped playing after a while because me sister wouldn’t have time for it anymore. I also didn’t know all the weird stuff or the stuff that is secluded, like castling, stalemate and the difference between check and checkmate. And so I gave up on chess.
Keep it up!
Chess
FALSELY Banned
3
I have been playing on this app religiously for over a year now! I was pretty bad at first. But now I've been banned for no reason. 
Unban me.
Chess
Toxic players. False reporting and hard to contact support
3
I find this less toxic than the League of Legends community (but nothing is that toxic). Player will quit while you are in a timed game and waste time from your life.
Please regulate the community
Chess
Checkmate!
5
I’ve been using this Chess app for about three or four years. It has a lot of additional features like tactics puzzles, videos, and preset predicaments to challenge you and help you set up future moves to create the best situation for your pieces.
Keep it up!

Great Mobile FPS!

This game is probably the most if not the best first and sometimes third person shooter. As a kid who practically grew up with the Call of Duty franchise, I like how they implemented some of the characters from modern warfare and Black ops.
Upgrade this app further.

Love the game, one major problem

Hi, I love Subway Surfers. It’s a great game with lots of cool features. There’s just one major setback. I can’t watch ads.
Please remove those annoying ads or have a paying option.
Subway Surfers
I’d pay to remove ads
4
Hey there! Subway Surfers is legit a classic cellphone game and i miss the days where i would play it all the time so that’s why i downloaded it again recently. The only gripe i have is the fact that it’s ad based. I personally would pay maybe $5-10 to remove ads permanently. 
Please add this feature.
